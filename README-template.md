## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox
to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You
can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long
the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to
take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase
it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and
update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot.
If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire
section.**

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above
with your own choices**

### What I learned

i learnt how to use the object fit property and understand how it works also
sharpened my skill on building a navigation bar by learing a few tricks(i know
right kind of funny ðŸ˜‚ that i never really understood how the DOM workedðŸ˜¥
mostly relied on codes on the web or bootstrap components ðŸ˜ª to do that) i also
learnt how to access an event with the target property to close the mobile
navigation if the event.target is the overlayðŸ˜Ž. Also added some minute
animation on the navigation links in the mobile menu.

### Continued development
I would love to add some  animations to some sections  as the page loads up.("When i have more time ðŸ¥±")
